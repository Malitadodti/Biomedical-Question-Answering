# Biomedical-Question-Answering
ABSTRACT :
Question Answering (QA) is a complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) task. It involves understanding 
a question, retrieving relevant materials, and generating a suitable answer. Its major challenge is to create 
proper representations of the language and to produce a suitable answer to a given question. Pretraining 
neural language models has significantly improved many natural language processing tasks. In particular, 
BERT is a deeply bidirectional, pre-trained language representation that has performed well in NLP tasks 
including question answering. In this thesis work, we study the application of the BERT technique to 
automated response generation for biomedical text mining. This application comes from the 
consideration that, due to the growth of the volume of biomedical papers, biomedical text mining is 
demanding better techniques to automate the extraction and the summarization of the biomedical 
information and to automate the responses to the queries. To be successful in answering biomedical 
questions, the lack of the availability of large expert-annotated biomedical datasets must be addressed. 
In the present thesis work, we consider augmenting the data samples from existing ones by varying 
context lengths. We have studied how dynamic changes in the passage length affect the performance of 
the models. This provides us with a better understanding of the optimal context lengths. To learn about 
the behaviour of the models when unanswerable questions are present, datasets with various ratios of 
answerable and unanswerable questions are used and the experiments show a significant range of the 
behaviour of the prediction models on different training and testing sets. During the experiments, a new 
span selection technique is implemented for predicting the answers. According to the experiments, it 
offers satisfactory improvement to the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art techniques for performing 
question-answering tasks in the context of biomedical text mining.
